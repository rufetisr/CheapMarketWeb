## ✨ Overview
**CheapMarket** is a powerful web application designed to simplify the online shopping experience. Instead of opening dozens of tabs to find the best price, CheapMarket aggregates data from various retailers into a single, clean dashboard. 

Built with performance and user experience in mind, it allows users to search for products and see the best available deals in real-time.

Built with **Google Gemini AI** and **OCR technology**, it empowers users to not only find the lowest prices but also decode complex food labels and track long-term market fluctuations to maximize their savings.
